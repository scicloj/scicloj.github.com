The scicloj community is organizing an online hackathon for studying COVID-19 data.
During one day, we will study together the COVID-19 story, using global and local data, in Clojure.

Please mark your preferred dates [here](https://doodle.com/poll/8imu9dyqmftygihs).

Our goal is multiple:

- learn about the pandemic
- try out the emerging Clojure data science stack
- bring the community together



## Q&A

Q: What background is assumed?

A: If you feel comfortable with reading and writing Clojure, you are invited.

Q: I like Clojure, but I want to use other tools and languages.

A: Sure. We like building bridges to other ecosystems.

Q: Do you assume any additional scientific background?

A: No. Some of us like probability and statistics, but it is just fine if your taste is different.

Q: I can only attend for a few hours. Is it ok?

A: Yes.

Q: I have a friend who is curious about studying these data and does not know Clojure. Can I invite my friend?

A: It would be great to invite your friend, as long as you find a way to collaborate (e.g., connect your Clojure code to their work; do some pair-coding; or just involve them in the thinking and theoretical analysis).



Wishes for good health and better times!
